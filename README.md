## Overview

This repository contains my files for the Module 3 project in the ETH + AVAX Proof: Intermediate EVM Course. It holds a contract named `NewToken.sol`, which is a smart contract for an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes functionalities for minting, transferring, and burning tokens. The key functionalities of the contract are:

- `mintTokens(address to, uint256 amount)`: Allows the owner to mint new tokens to a specified address.
- `transferTokens(address to, uint256 amount)`: Allows any user to transfer tokens to another address.
- `burnTokens(uint256 amount)`: Allows any user to burn their own tokens.
